                    <h4>What is iAmaze?</h4>
                    <p>
                        iAmaze is a puzzle-strategy maze game in which the players have the chance to play
one of the roles: The God or a Runner. Each role is completely different with a different POV and
a different goal. In the game, the runners will have to escape from a maze with various puzzles in
limited time. On the other hand, the goal of the God is to stop them from getting out of the maze.
Both roles will have multiple characters each having different abilities that will lead them to victory.
The God will be granted a godlike point of view, where he sees the entire maze from above, while
the runners will be in first-person. The map will be done manually, and to have each time a different
experience, we will divide the map into different sectors that will be interchangeable. Each sector will
have its own theme and its own puzzle, entries, and exits, and in each game, the entry and the exit
of the maze will be different. The runners will be granted a map that will only reveal path already
discovered. In the maze, rewards will be granted to runners for solving additional and optional
challenges that will be given by the God, but once accepted, if the challenge isn't completed, a
reward will be granted to the God.
