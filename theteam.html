                        I’m the gamer of the group, but not the kind of guy who plays sometime on his free time, I have played video games all my life since I was a little kid and still playing them a lot till now. Making a video game was my dream which combines my 2 passions, gaming and coding. The idea of creating my own game, with my own character, story, rules, mechanics, fascinates me so much. My goal for the project is nowhere near having a good grade. My only goal is to make the best game I can while just having fun. As the gamer of the group I give a lot of ideas to the game, and arrange them so that the game can be playable as not too easy nor too hard and adding features that make the game more fun, as a game designer. I’ll be in charge of most of the mechanics of the game, using Unity game engine and C sharp with rider.
Making my first game is not just a project to present in front of a jury, making my first game is the door to my future, knowing where I stand, what I can achieve and what I can create. We will all give our best for this game and will give everything we have to do it as best as we can.

                        Being the only non-gamer in my group, I felt like I was the least motivated person of the team before starting the project, but when we began discussing it, I started appreciating the freedom and the opportunity we had to express our creativity through this task. When discussing the game, lots of ideas would flow to mind. Being a creative person who usually likes arts (mainly photography and using photo shop), I liked to focus on the graphics of the game since I have always been intrigued to learn how to do create 3d models for games and for different applications. It is an opportunity for me to learn blender and put my creativity in use for this project. I am usually considered more of a scientific guy who loves programming. I have developed a love for problem-solving which has made good enough at solving various algorithmic-like problems. This is why I would like to code some of the tricky rules the game would potentially have. Being someone that is usually punctual, I identify myself as the secretary of the group, mainly managing documents and deadlines.

                        My interest in games has always been apparent, but never in a million years did I believe I would be in a position to make one. It felt like a tedious task at first, especially since we were expected to be original, and the pressure is still evident as I write this… The idea of a maze-based game was not suggested by me, but as soon as I heard it, I knew it would be the perfect idea. It reminded me of when I used to play mini-games like Pac-Man as a child. I had many visions for the aesthetic part of our game; to give it a bit of life and step out of the overused colors a normal video game would have. That was when we mutually decided I would design textures and come up with the colorful and stylish ideas including background music and sound effects for the game. With this project, my main goal is to have fun, no matter what happens. I also feel the need to be the “happy pill” of the team just to keep the morale when everyone is feeling down and exasperated. I have so many hopes for this game to the point where it got real at one group meeting where we discussed wanting to publish our game on an online platform by the end of 2020. I believe we are a group with diverse personalities, giving us room for a strong flow of creative thoughts and with that, we can conquer any obstacle in our way.
